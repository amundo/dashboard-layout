# README - Demonstrating a simple dashboard layout with CSS Grid

This repository demonstrates a simple dashboard layout using CSS Grid. The goal was to use as little `CSS` as possible to create a dashboard layout with internal scrollable panes.

To add some random content, and for fun, I implemented a simple Wikipedia article viewer that loads articles via the Wikipedia API. In many cases the article will be longer than the `<main>` elementâ€™s height, and thus scrolling will be activated. For longer articles with many sections, the dynamic table of contents in the `<aside>` will also scroll.
